7. Extend for Ray Tracing:
Gradually extend your project by integrating ray tracing functionality. Implement the basic ray tracing algorithms, and progressively add features like reflections, shadows, and more advanced effects.

8. Experiment with Shaders:
As your project progresses, experiment with OpenGL shaders to enhance the visual aspects of your ray tracer. Shaders can be used for post-processing effects or custom materials.

9. Explore Additional Libraries:
Consider exploring additional C++ libraries for tasks such as vector/matrix operations (e.g., GLM), image loading (e.g., STB Image), or other utilities that might enhance your ray tracer.
